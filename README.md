# Kalvium Lab | Pro-Hooks

## Learning Goals

In this exercise, the aim is to understand the following hooks:

- useMemo
- useCallback

### Steps to follow:

1. clone this repository.
2. use `npm install` or `npm i`, to install all the dependancies.
3. use `npm run dev` to run the application - and check whether the application is running or not.

# Task:

Initially, you will see the application running in the following manner -

And if you open you console, you will see the console, in the following way -

**NOTE:** You must have observed, the delay while clicking on the `dark` and `change value` button. You must have observed that, when you change the background color, there is a delay.

Your task is to optimize the given code, and remove the delay - as shown below:

**NOTE:** You must have also observed, that initially, in your console, if you click any button --> 
`Delay function ran` and `callback function was called` --> these two text message get consoled everytime you click any of the three buttons.

Your task is to optimize the code in such a way --> that these two texts : `Delay function ran` and `callback function was called`, only appear in console, when you click on `change value ` button - as shown below:
